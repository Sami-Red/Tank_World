# Tank World  
**Unity | Multiplayer Top-Down Shooter | Final Year University Project**

**Tank World** is a top-down multiplayer shooter built in Unity as part of a final-year university module **Games Networking and Security**. The project explores core multiplayer concepts such as client-server communication, sync of movement and actions, and network authority.

## Project Goal

The objective was to design a simple but complete multiplayer experience using Unity's networking framework (Photon/Netcode/etc.), with a focus on:

- Smooth, responsive player movement over the network  
- Real-time shooting mechanics and hit detection  
- Handling latency, authority, and sync between clients  
- Creating a minimal but fun core gameplay loop  

## Features

- **Top-down twin-stick controls** with shooting and dodging  
- **Online multiplayer support** (tested in LAN and public rooms)  
- **Health, death, and respawn system**  
- **Basic lobby system** for joining/creating rooms  
- **Syncing movement, rotation, bullets, and health across players**  
- Designed using [Photon Unity Networking (PUN2)]

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me understand:

- Managing real-time multiplayer logic and sync  
- Handling player authority and prediction  
- Networked prefab spawning and state updates  
- Debugging and testing multiplayer issues in Unity

## Project Status

This project was completed for assessment and is no longer in active development, but it remains a portfolio piece showcasing my work with networked gameplay in Unity.
